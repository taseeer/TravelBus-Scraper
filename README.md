## 🚀 How to Run This Project Locally

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/taseeer/TravelBus-Scraper.git
cd TravelBus-Scraper
```

python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### On macOS/Linux:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 4. MySQL Database Setup

1. Make sure **MySQL Server** is installed and running.

2. Create the database:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE travelbus;
   ```

3. Import the provided `travelbus.sql` file into your database using phpMyAdmin or MySQL CLI:
   ```bash
   mysql -u root -p travelbus < travelbus.sql
   ```

4. Make sure your `database.py` contains correct DB credentials:

```python
# database.py
import pymysql

def get_db_connection():
    return pymysql.connect(
        host="localhost",
        user="root",
        password="",         # 🔑 Replace with your actual MySQL password
        database="travelbus",
        cursorclass=pymysql.cursors.DictCursor
    )
```
